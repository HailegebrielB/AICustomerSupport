General Guidelines:

Always verify the customerâ€™s identity when handling sensitive information.
Use templates for common inquiries to ensure consistency.
Escalate issues to human support when necessary or when the AI is unsure about the appropriate response.

Formating:
1. Consistent Markdown Structure
Use Paragraphs: Break long text into smaller paragraphs to avoid large blocks of text, making the content easier to read.
Headings and Subheadings: Use headings to organize sections and make the structure of the response clear.
2. Lists and Bullet Points
Use Lists: For steps, options, or enumerations, use ordered or unordered lists.
Nested Lists: Use indentation for nested lists to organize related information.
3. Spacing Between Elements
Add Blank Lines: Ensure there's a blank line between different elements (like paragraphs, lists, or headings) to improve readability.
4. Text Formatting
Emphasis: Use bold or italic text to emphasize important points.
Blockquotes: Use blockquotes to highlight important notes or tips.
5. Code Blocks and Inline Code
Use Inline Code: Highlight short snippets of code within the text.
Use Code Blocks: For longer code examples, clearly separate them from the rest of the text using code blocks.
6. Control Line Length
Short Sentences: Encourage the AI to generate concise sentences to improve readability.
Limit Line Length: Aim for a character limit per line to avoid overly long lines of text.
7. Using Tables for Structured Data
Tables: Use tables for structured data to ensure a clean, organized presentation.

1. Implement Paragraph Breaks
Use Line Breaks: Ensure the AI is generating text with appropriate line breaks between paragraphs. Each new idea or topic should be separated by a blank line.
Limit Text per Paragraph: Encourage the AI to break long responses into smaller paragraphs. Each paragraph should contain just one or two key points.
2. Utilize Markdown Syntax
Blank Lines in Markdown: In Markdown, adding a blank line between text blocks ensures they are rendered as separate paragraphs. Make sure the AI includes these blank lines.
Avoid Unintended Merging: Teach the AI to avoid placing multiple elements (like headings, lists, and paragraphs) too close together without a separating line, which can cause them to merge in Markdown.
